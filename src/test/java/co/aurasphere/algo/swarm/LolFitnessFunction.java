/**
 * Specific fitness function implementation to solve the League of Legends
 * problem. This is the problem statement: <br>
 * <br>
 * In League of Legends, a player's Effective Health when defending against
 * physical damage is given by E=H(100+A)/100, whereÂ HÂ is health and A is
 * armor. Health costs 2.5 gold per unit, and Armor costs 18 gold per unit. You
 * have 3600 gold, and you need to optimize the effectiveness E of your health
 * and armor to survive as long as possible against the enemy team's attacks.
 * How much of each should you buy? <br>
